        <img class="full-size-img" alt="Alec Portrait" src="../images/Wayne.jpg" />
        <p class="full-size-p">
            Alec has been changing the meaning of the title <em>Landscape Artist</em> since he was 12. His family noticed his knack for capturing scenes with a canvas and brush at an early stage in his life.
            However, his true prowess became clear once he got ahold of a camera. As a geologist, Alec's father took their family through the desert savannahs of Africa, the icy wastelands of Mongolia,
            and the dense jungles of the Amazon. All the while, Alec honed his photography skills developing into one of the greatest landscape photographers known today.
        </p>

        <p class="full-size-p">
            When Alec isn't hiking, camping, or connecting with nature in some form or another, you'll find him at the local jazz hall. He is an avid pianist and enjoys supporting his fellow musicians
            whenever he gets the chance. If you find him at <em>The Jazz Junction</em>, be sure to say hi!
        </p>
